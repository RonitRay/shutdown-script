# shutdown-script
A script that can log out, shut down, or reboot your PC. Helpful if you are using a minimal window manager that doesn't have the functionality, and replaces (imo) more bloated options like oblogout etc. 

Personally using it on i3-gaps, I have it bound to $mod+Shift+E instead of the default nagbar+exit functionality. Will work for any WM/DE provided you replace the logout command with whatever the WM accepts.

# Requirements
None, basically just bash or a compliant shell.

Clone the repo or just create the file in a directory and chmod +x to make it executable. You can then run it from a terminal or bind it to a key combination for convenience.
